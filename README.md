# IAMCloudSecurity

In AWS, a "user" can be an individual or an automated system that interacts with the vast capabilities of the AWS cloud. 

Through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), you gain precise control over who can access your resources, ensuring that only authenticated users—those securely signed in, are granted the specific permissions they need to execute tasks. IAM empowers you to safeguard your cloud environment by meticulously defining and managing access rights, so you maintain both security and operational efficiency.
